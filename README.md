### What I learned

After doing some frontend mentor projects I think there was no new concept to learn in this project, but there was some colors missing in [style-guide.md](style-guide.md) so I learned to pick color from image from different sites. And it also gave me some more experience

### Continued development

I don't think there is anything more to develop in this project but I am open to any suggestion for improvement. So feel free to give your honest feedbacks. 

### Useful resources

- [Coolors](https://coolors.co) - This site is best to choose colors for your project. It has a very large color pallete library and also help you to generate your own color pallete from images.
